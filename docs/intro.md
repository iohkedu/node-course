# Course Introduction

Welcome to the Cardano Node Operations Course! This hands-on course will help guide you through setting up and using a Cardano node.

## Course Environment

Though this course was designed to utilize the Cardano Mobile Node Lab, a Raspberry Pi is not required. The course also assumes that you are using SSH to connect to a remote server. You may also work though this guide on a local machine, though some of the commands might look a little different.

## Recommended hardware and Operating System(s) for this course: 
- Since we will be working on the Preview testnet, anything with at least 4GB or RAM should be OK. Though the more the better.
- I recommend a Debian-based Linux distro, like Ubuntu 22.04 or Debian 12, you may use others if you are familiar with them and their package managers and dependencies.

## What You'll Learn

- Setting up and configuring the `cardano-node`
- Using `mithril` to download a snapshot
- Creating and managing keys and addresses
- Executing transactions on the Preview network
- Configuring logging for effective monitoring
- Configuring `kupo` and `ogmios`

## Prerequisites

- Basic command line experience (it's ok if you are a bit new to this)
- Familiarity with blockchain concepts
- SSH client if connecting to a remote server

## Course Format

This is a practical, hands-on guide where you'll work directly with Cardano tools and infrastructure.
