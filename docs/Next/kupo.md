# Kupo

![kupo1](/img/kupopic1.png)

[Kupo](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo) is a very fast and lightweight chain-index for the Cardano blockchain. It is like a lightweight version of [db-sync](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-db-sync). Chain indexers are useful to developers and service providers in that they process and organize raw blockchain data to suit developer needs. 

Similar to `ogmios`, we are going to grab a pre-compiled static `kupo` binary a server. 

```
cd /tmp

wget https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo/releases/download/v2.11/kupo-v2.11.0-aarch64-linux.zip
```
Unzip it

```
unzip kupo-v2.11.0-aarch64-linux.zip
```

Copy it to our bin directory

```
cp /tmp/bin/kupo /home/n(x)/preview/bin/
```
Again, make sure we have it in the right place

```
which kupo
```
```
kupo --version
```
![kupover](/img/kupover1.png)

Let's create a startup script. 

```
nano /home/n(x)/preview/scripts/kupo_start.sh
```

Copy the follwing into the `kupo_start.sh` file.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Kupo configuration:
# - Using local Ogmios instance on port 1337
# - Matching all patterns with "*"
# - Starting from specific block
# - Deferring DB indexes for faster startup
# - Working directory in user's home
# - Listening on all interfaces on port 1442

/home/n(x)/preview/bin/kupo \
--ogmios-port 1337 \
--match "*" \
--since "54412148.656e903c510441032ad566d26fecf7be98882bdefde6a1ed961cd8e7bfa9d18a" \
--defer-db-indexes \
--workdir /home/n(x)/preview/kupo-db \
--ogmios-host 127.0.0.1 \
--host 0.0.0.0 \
--port 1442
```

Save and exit, `ctrl + o` and `ctrl + x`.

Make it executable and start it. 

```
chmod +x /home/n(x)/preview/scripts/kupo_start.sh

cd /home/n(x)/preview/scripts/

./kupo_start.sh
```

You should see output of `kupo` syncing.

Exit the process `ctrl + c`

Now let's make another service file in the `scripts` directory. 

```
nano /home/n(x)/preview/scripts/kupo.service
```

Copy the following into your service file. 

```
[Unit]
Description       = Kupo
Wants             = network-online.target
After             = network-online.target  
  
[Service]
User              = n(x)
Type              = simple
WorkingDirectory  = /home/n(x)/preview
ExecStart         = /bin/bash -c '/home/n(x)/preview/scripts/kupo_start.sh'
KillSignal        = SIGINT
RestartKillSignal = SIGINT
LimitNOFILE       = 24000
Restart           = always
RestartSec        = 7
SyslogIdentifier  = kupo
  
[Install]
WantedBy          = multi-user.target
```

Copy the service file to your system directory. 

```
sudo cp /home/n(x)preview/scripts/kupo.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

Give it the correct permissions. 

```
sudo chmod 0644 /etc/systemd/system/kupo.service
```

Reload daemons.

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Start the service. 

```
sudo systemctl start kupo.service
```

Check the status. 

```
sudo systemctl status kupo.service
```

It should say "active"

If active, enable the service. 

```
sudo systemctl enable kupo.service
```

Now lets allow connections to port `1442` for queries. 

```
sudo ufw allow 1442/tcp
```

Reload. 

```
sudo ufw reload
```

Now let's see if it is working! 

From a local terminal session on your machine (meaning not logged into your server).

We are going to curl health metrics from your `kupo` endpoint. 

```
curl "http://yourserverip:1442/health"
```

If everything is correctly configured, you will see output similar to this.
