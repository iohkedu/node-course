# Ogmios

![ogmiospic](/img/ogmiospic.png)

From the developer at https://ogmios.dev/faq : *"Ogmios is a lightweight bridge interface for `cardano-node`. It offers a WebSockets API that enables local clients to speak Ouroboros' mini-protocols via JSON/RPC. Ogmios is a fast and lightweight solution that can be deployed alongside relays to create entry points on the Cardano network for various types of applications"*

It is a very convenient component of the Cardano ecosystem that many projects take advantage of as part of their projects. Today we are going to set it up alongside our running `cardano-node`

Ok, next let's grab the latest static binary of the arm build from the developer.

```
cd /tmp

wget https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/ogmios/releases/download/v6.13.0/ogmios-v6.13.0-aarch64-linux.zip
```
Unzip the archive

```
unzip ogmios-v6.13.0-aarch64-linux.zip
```
Copy the binary from the extracted bin to our specified bin directory

```
cp /tmp/bin/ogmios ~/preview/bin/
```
Ensure your system sees it
```
ogmios --version
```

Let's make this API endpoint available externally. 

```
sudo ufw allow 1337/tcp
```

Reload ufw

```
sudo ufw reload
```

Check ufw status

```
sudo ufw status
```

You should see port 1337 on the list. 

## Make a script

Now we need to create a script to start `ogmios`.

```
nano /home/n(x)/preview/scripts/ogmios_start.sh
```

Next, let's give it the correct startup options. You'll notice some of the startup options on `ogmios` is similar to `cardano-node`. We are going to set the port to 1337, and the IP to listening at `0.0.0.0`. 

Add the following to the `ogmios_start.sh` file you just opened in nano.

```
#!/bin/bash
#
/home/n(x)/preview/bin/ogmios --node-socket /home/n(x)/preview/socket/node.socket \
--node-config /home/n(x)/preview/config/config.json \
--host 0.0.0.0 \
--port 1337
```

Save and exit `ctrl + o` and `ctrl + x`.

Make the script executable. 

```
chmod +x /home/n(x)/preview/scripts/ogmios_start.sh
```

Let's test the script in our terminal window.

```
cd /home/n(x)/preview/scripts

./ogmios_start.sh

```

While this is running, open a browser window on your machine and enter the URL of your server on port `1337`

Example: http://10.42.0.1(x):1337

You should be greeted with a nice dashboard.

Go ahead and kill the running process in your terminal with `ctrl + c`

Next, let's automate the script with systemd. 

## Make the Service

Create the sample service file. 

```
nano /home/n(x)/preview/scripts/ogmios.service
```

Add the following basic systemd configuration to the file you just opened with nano. 

```
[Unit]
Description       = Ogmios
Wants             = network-online.target
After             = network-online.target  
  
[Service]
User              = n(x)
Type              = simple
WorkingDirectory  = /home/n(x)/preview/scripts/
ExecStart         = /bin/bash -c '/home/n(x)/preview/scripts/ogmios_start.sh'
KillSignal        = SIGINT
RestartKillSignal = SIGINT
LimitNOFILE       = 24000
Restart           = always
RestartSec        = 7
SyslogIdentifier  = ogmios
  
[Install]
WantedBy          = multi-user.target
```

Copy the service file to the system directory. 

```
sudo cp /home/n(x)/preview/scripts/ogmios.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

Give the service the correct permissions. 

```
sudo chmod 0644 /etc/systemd/system/ogmios.service
```
Reload daemons.

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Start the `ogmios` service. 

```
sudo systemctl start ogmios.service
```

Check the service. 

```
sudo systemctl status ogmios.service
```
If it shows `active`, we can enable the service. 

```
sudo systemctl enable ogmios.service
```
Go open your `ogmios` dashoboard again in your browser and proudly observe the fruits of your labor.
