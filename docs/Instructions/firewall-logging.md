# Logging, Firewall, and Monitoring

## A couple of Daemons

Before moving forward, let's talk about and add a couple of services to our server. 

The first one is **fail2ban**

**fail2ban** is a daemon that monitors and bans clients that repeatedly fail authentication checks such as brute forcing SSH. 

It is a good idea to run this on any publicly accessible server.

```
sudo apt install -y fail2ban
```

The other generic service I'd like to install is **chrony**

**chrony** is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol. **Cardano** is very dependent on time and requires that block producing nodes, relays, and any other node keep accurate time. This is especially critical for block producing nodes as the network expects blocks to be minted and propogated within a second (slot). With default settings **chrony** will regularly check in with publicly available ntp servers. In our case it will check with `pool.ntp.org`. While we have the ability to configure many options in `/etc/chrony.conf`, such as specifying a lower stratum NTP server, the default settings should be more than adequate for our purposes.

```
sudo apt install -y chrony
```

Once installed, check to ensure **chrony** is keeping your server in sync.

```
chronyc tracking
```

## Firewall

Running any internet-accessible infrastructure requires some security measures to be taken, and the firewall is one of the most important. Today, we will be using **ufw** (uncomplicated firewall) which comes packaged with our Ubuntu server Linux distribution. **ufw** is just a simple and user friendly frontend for **iptables**, which allows us to configure IP packet filtering rules of the Linux kernel firewall.

First, let's set a couple of default rules. 

The first default is to deny incoming traffic.

```
sudo ufw default deny incoming
```

Next default is to allow outgoing.

```
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
```

Make sure to allow the **ssh** service to be reached on your server.

```
sudo ufw allow ssh
```

:::tip

In production, it is a best practice to change the port your SSH server uses to something higher and not often used (default is port 22), as there are many scanners out there looking specifically for port 22, and many scanners start scanning at a lower number. We are not going to do this today for a couple of reasons: time, these are not publicly accessible, and these servers are not critical infrastructure.

:::

:::danger

If you skip this step and enable the firewall, you will no longer be able to access your server!

:::


Let's make our `cardano-node` port available.

```
sudo ufw allow 1694/tcp
```

:::info

The `cardano-node` node-to-node (NtN) protocol was designed to facilitate two-way communication over a single outgoing `TCP/IP` connection. This means that we can connect with many other nodes even if we did not allow incoming connections on our specified port.

:::

Next we need to open the port for the Prometheus node exporter (more on that in a minute...)

```
sudo ufw allow 9100/tcp
```

Then let's open the port to our `cardano-node` Prometheus exporter.

```
sudo ufw allow 12798/tcp
```

Finally, let's enable the firewall. 

```
sudo ufw enable
```

Then reload it.

```
sudo ufw reload
```

If everything was done correctly your SSH session should still be active.

Let's get an overview of our rules real quick.

```
sudo ufw status
```

## Logging and Monitoring

The next thing we need to do is to turn on some logging and monitoring for our node.

`cardano-node` comes with the ability to produce **Prometheus** metrics by default. 

:::info

**Prometheus** is an open-source monitoring system

:::

To allow a **Prometheus** server to scrape data from our node, we need to make an adjustment to our node configuration file. 

```
nano /home/n(x)/preview/config/config.json
```

Find the `"hasPrometheus"` line and change the IP from the localhost `127.0.0.1` to listening `0.0.0.0`

```
  "hasPrometheus": [
    "0.0.0.0",
    12798
  ],
```

We're not quite ready to save and exit the file yet, while we're in here editing, let's make a couple of adjustments to enable logging. 

The first we're going to change is the defaultl logging location. This will specify where logs are written if no setup scribe is configured. 

Find `"defaultScribes"` and we are going to change it from Stdout to FileSK, with a path to the logs directory we created earlier. 

```
  "defaultScribes": [
    [
      "FileSK",
      "/home/n(x)/preview/logs/cardano.json"
    ]
  ],
```

Now we are going to specify the `"setupScribes"` output. Find the `"setupScribes"` line and modify it to match the following.

```
    "setupScribes": [
    {
      "scFormat": "ScJson",
      "scKind": "FileSK",
      "scName": "/home/n(x)/preview/logs/cardano.json",
      "scRotation": null
    }
  ]
```

:::tip

Be careful to preserve the `.json` formatting when adjusting these. It is easy to break the configuration file and prevent your node from starting by accidentally deleting a comma or causing some other syntax error.

:::

Once your `config.json` file has been updated, go ahead and save `ctrl + o` and exit `ctrl + x`

To make these changes active, we need to restart the node.

```
sudo systemctl restart node.service
```

Give it a few seconds and then check to make sure the service is running. 

```
sudo systemctl status node.service
```

You can also query the tip again. 

```
cardano-cli query tip --testnet-magic 2
```

:::tip

If you are getting a "socket not found" error when doing this, but your `node.service` is active, give the node a minute to startup until the socket file is created and try again.

:::

Let's take a live look at our logs with the tail command

```
cd /home/n(x)/preview/logs/
tail -f n !! cardano.json
```

You should see the live log output of your `cardano-node` to the `cardano.json` file being written to. 

`ctrl + c` to end the command

Next, let's install the **Prometheus** node exporter. 

```
sudo apt install -y prometheus-node-exporter
```

This automatically starts the service and the **Prometheus** server I have configured should be able to scrape your server as an endpoint. You should be able to see your node stats appear on the **Grafana** dashboard now.
